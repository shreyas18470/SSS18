OOPs: object orianted programming structure/system

OOPs is style/design/paradigm of writing a programbased on an object

object: real world entities which have features and perform some functions (behaviors)

features --> variables
behaviors--> functions

but we need an entity to bind these variables and functions together, but we cannot have object as basic entity.

because:
1.there can be multiple objects for same type, ex:blue zombies:
  when we define objects we have repeat the code for variables and functions every time we 
  
2. objects are independent of each other: changes made on an object should not affect others.
   ex: when i hit a blue zombie that one should die and others should not be effected 

if we keenly observe any object is a member of larger type/category class.

we decided to first define a class consisting of features and functions .

then using this class as blueprint/mould to create distinct /seperate objects of that class .

fundamental concepts in oops:
1: class
2: objects - derived entities/ instance of a class
>>four  pillars of oops:
3. inheritance
4. polymorphism
5. abstraction - interface
6. encapsultion
